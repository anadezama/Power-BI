# Format Guidelines for Power BI visualization in GP Mobile

> Inside the Report tab you can add some visualizations like tables, graphs, donut charts, bar charts, KPIs, maps, etc. All of these options must have the format requirements to make up the **GP Mobile look**. 


First thing you have to know is that the T-Mobile magenta-pink color is the star in every visualization. Any kind of visualization should include this color.

The GP Mobile / T-Mobile magenta-pink color code is: **EA0A8E** _in Hex Color Code_
